2. RandomForestClassifier gave 81.26%

Here is a quick explanation of some of the features od the dataset:

Ticket: ticket id Fare: price paid (in pounds)
Cabin: passenger's cabin number
Embarked: where the passenger embarked the Titanic
The dataset is split into 2 parts, train.csv and test.csv for training and testing your Machine Learning models respectively.
